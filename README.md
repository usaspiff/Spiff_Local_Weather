# Spiff_Local_Weather

This is my Local Weather App for the freeCodeCamp Intermediate Front End project.

The page contains the following features:
<ul>
<li>Displays the current weather at the user's location.</li>
<li>Clicking the temperature button switches between Fahrenheit and Celsius degrees.</li>
<li>Clicking the wind speed button switches between mph and km/h.</li>
<li>Background image will vary depending on the current weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
